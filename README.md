This PHP script is a versatile solution for managing communication with your Telegram bot. It streamlines the process of sending text messages, photos, and videos while ensuring seamless integration with your MySQL database. Whether for notifications, updates, or media sharing, this tool is designed for efficiency and simplicity.

Features üåü
Effortless Text Messaging: Send clear and concise text messages to your bot with ease.

Prerequisites ‚úÖ
What You Need:
Telegram Bot Token
Obtain a unique token for your bot by interacting with @BotFather. This token is required to authenticate with the Telegram Bot API.

MySQL Database
Set up a database to store the chat IDs of users. These IDs will act as the target for your messages.

Web Server with PHP
Host the script on a web server capable of executing PHP. Popular choices include local environments (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP) or cloud-based hosting.

Installation and Setup üöÄ
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Use the following command to download the project:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/abirxdhackz/Broadcast-Code.git
Step 2: Configure the Database Connection
Open the index.php file and update the database details:

php
Copy code
$Serverhost = "localhost"; // MySQL host (e.g., 'localhost')
$Serverusername = "root";  // MySQL username
$Serverpassword = "";      // MySQL password
$Serverdatabase = "";      // Database name
Step 3: Add Your Telegram Bot Token
Replace the placeholder in index.php with your bot's token:

php
Copy code
$bot_token = "your-telegram-bot-token";
Step 4: Create the Required Database Table
Log into your MySQL database and run this SQL query to set up the table:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE `IntecDevid` (
  `chat_id` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
Step 5: Populate the Database Table
Insert chat IDs of your target users into the IntecDevid table:

Manual Entry: Use tools like phpMyAdmin or the MySQL CLI.
Automated Entry: Capture chat IDs dynamically by prompting users to interact with your bot.
Step 6: Upload Files to Your Web Server
Place the project files (index.php, styles.css, etc.) on your web server. Ensure file permissions allow execution and media access.

Step 7: Access the Application
Open a web browser and navigate to the URL where the script is hosted. The user-friendly interface will guide you through sending messages and media.
