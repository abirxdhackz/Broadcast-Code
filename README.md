## Installation and Setup üöÄ

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Use the following command to download the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abirxdhackz/Broadcast-Code.git
```

### Step 2: Configure the Database Connection
Open the `index.php` file and update the database details:
```php
$Serverhost = "localhost"; // MySQL host (e.g., 'localhost')
$Serverusername = "root";  // MySQL username
$Serverpassword = "";      // MySQL password
$Serverdatabase = "";      // Database name
```

### Step 3: Add Your Telegram Bot Token
Replace the placeholder in `index.php` with your bot's token:
```php
$bot_token = "your-telegram-bot-token";
```

### Step 4: Create the Required Database Table
Log into your MySQL database and run this SQL query to set up the table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE `IntecDevid` (
  `chat_id` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

### Step 5: Populate the Database Table
Insert chat IDs of your target users into the `IntecDevid` table:
- **Manual Entry**: Use tools like phpMyAdmin or the MySQL CLI.
- **Automated Entry**: Capture chat IDs dynamically by prompting users to interact with your bot.

### Step 6: Upload Files to Your Web Server
Place the project files (`index.php`, `styles.css`, etc.) on your web server. Ensure file permissions allow execution and media access.

### Step 7: Access the Application
Open a web browser and navigate to the URL where the script is hosted. The user-friendly interface will guide you through sending messages and media.
